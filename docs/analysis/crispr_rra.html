<p><strong>Td- vs.&nbsp;iN at Day14 (S8/S6):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These cells became non-neurons, the <strong>enrichment</strong> of guides found from S8 / S6 means that these guides discrupt TFs that may be crucial to neuron development. Because these cells failed to become neurons, <strong>enrichment</strong> of these guides mean TFs responsible for neuron development are disrupted.</li>

<p><strong>Td- vs.&nbsp;Td+ at Day14 (S8/S7)</strong></p>

<li>S8 are non-neurons and S7 are neurons. The <strong>enrichment</strong> of guides found in neurons, while depleted in non-neurons, mean that these guides disrupte the function of TFs that are responsible for neuron development.</li>

<p><strong>Td+ vs.&nbsp;iN at Day14 (S7/S6)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>These cells became neurons. The <strong>enrichment</strong> of guides found from S7 - S6 means that these guides disrupt TFs that may be repressors of neuron development, or that these targetted TFs are reponsible for maintaining stem cell status.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>depletion</strong> of these guides means that the targeted TFs may be crucial to neuron development (since these cells have become neurons, you wouldn’t find many cells with neuron related TFs being disrupted, thus you observe depletion of gRNAs).</p></li>

<p>Notice a large number of overlaps. When we combine hits found from Td- vs.&nbsp;iN and Td- vs.&nbsp;Td+ with FDR &lt; 0.15 (which is the same way we selected our 120 hits. There are 23 (NEUROG1 and NEUROG2 are not considered) hits found in existing method, but not found in the RRA method. Nearly all the hits that we initially removed in our existing method, which are labeled as hit with the RRA method are non-targeting controls. This highlights the advantage of our existing manual method of more precise control of false positives and potential false negatives. Of course, the disadvantage is that the existing manual method does not produce a p-value thus is less informative in statistical confidence.</p>
<p>Below shows hits that are found in both this method and our existing method. Notice many of these TFs are repeatedly identified as differentially expressed as well as later identified as nodes in the putative neuronal development gene regulatory network.</p>

We selected a set of 5000 medium to highly expressed genes and plotted ATAC-seq signal strength at the 2kb up and down stream of TSS. The figures below demonstrate the trend that chromatin accessibility is enriched in the promoter regino of these genes, and that we can observe an overall increasing trend of chromatin accessibility as cells further commit to the neuronal developmental path. This increasing trend correlates with our observation in the RNA-seq dataset where significantly more genes are expressed as cells commit towards the neuronal path.\n\n\nCode\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../code/results/reviews/atac/deeptoolsplots/heatmap_tss_u1k_d1k_top5k_genes.pdf\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent of Reads in Peaks\nWe compared the percent of ATAC-seq reads allocated in peaks. The results show similar observation as we did in the enrichment analysis. As cells are further differentiated towards neurons, more regions of the genome, including protein coding genes / transcription factors, become more accessible. This is reflected in increasing enrichment in the promoter region as we discussed previously, as well as higher percentage of reads in the called peaks regions. Notably, the last two samples, two biological replicates of the final time point, have significantly more reads allocated in the peak regions.\n\n\nCode\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../code/results/reviews/atac/PRiP.pdf\")"
